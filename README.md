User Management Dashboard A simple web application for managing users. It allows you to view, add, edit, and delete user details using a mock backend API (JSONPlaceholder).

Features View Users:

Fetch and display a list of users with details like ID, Name, Email, and Department.

Add User:

Add a new user using a form. (Simulated using JSONPlaceholder.)

Edit User:

Edit an existing user's details. (Simulated using JSONPlaceholder.)

Delete User:

Delete a user from the list. (Simulated using JSONPlaceholder.)

Error Handling:

Displays error messages if API requests fail.

Responsive Design:

The UI is responsive and works on all screen sizes.

Technologies Used Frontend: React

Backend: JSONPlaceholder (Mock API)

HTTP Requests: Axios

Styling: CSS

Setup Instructions Prerequisites Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Steps to Run the Project Clone the Repository:

bash Copy git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-dashboard.git cd user-management-dashboard Install Dependencies:

bash Copy npm install Start the Development Server:

bash Copy npm start Open the Application:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Available Scripts In the project directory, you can run:

npm start Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

On page load, the application fetches users from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays them in a table.

Adding a User:

Click the "Add User" button to open the form.

Fill in the details and submit. The new user will be added to the list (simulated).

Editing a User:

Click the "Edit" button next to a user.

Update the details in the form and submit. The user's details will be updated in the list (simulated).

Deleting a User:

Click the "Delete" button next to a user.

The user will be removed from the list (simulated).

Simulated API Behavior JSONPlaceholder is a mock API, so it won't actually add, edit, or delete data on the server.

All changes are simulated and reflected in the local state of the application.

Error Handling If an API request fails, an error message will be displayed in the console.

The UI will not crash, and the user will be notified of the issue.

Future Improvements Real Backend Integration:

Replace JSONPlaceholder with a real backend API.

Pagination:

Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets.

Authentication:

Add user authentication and authorization.

Advanced Validation:

Add client-side validation for the user input form.

Unit Tests:

Write unit tests for all components and services.

Challenges Faced Simulated API Limitations:

JSONPlaceholder doesn't persist changes, so local state management was necessary.

State Management:

Ensuring the local state updates correctly after adding, editing, or deleting users.

Error Handling:

Handling API errors gracefully and displaying user-friendly messages.
